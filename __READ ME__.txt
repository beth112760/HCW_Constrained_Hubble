This code was written to solve the constrained HCW Equations for rendezvous and docking with the Hubble Space Telescope. A description of the files are below:

- HCW_constrained_hubble_main.m: the main file to compute the optimal constrained trajectory.
- HCWNAE_local_constrained_WORKS.m: the function file. Note: to obtain the unconstrained trajectory for comparison, comment out the initial k=2 section of residuals and Jacobian
- rbf0.m: computes the CRBF matrix
- rbf1.m: computes the time-derivative of the CRBF matrix
